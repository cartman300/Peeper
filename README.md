# Peeper
A screen recording software that doesn't spy on you (probably)!

Standard users recommended to run with /no-ads /disable-voyeur /disable-rootkit

It's as simple to use as the gifcam tool, by default it outputs uncompressed avi file.
To use the "webm" checkbox (which compresses the video and removes the uncompressed one) it's required to have ffmpeg in either path or the same folder as the executable.
The numeric textbox is the target framerate.
